This project is done, as the self-inducted deadline have already passed.
Im quite happy with the amount of content I have added and with deepening the knowledge I've gotten, but at the present time, I would need to basically re-write entire code here.

It will sit here to be reminder for me, that people made design patterns for a reason. : )

Original readme:
# Allegro-Test
A small c++ test for Allegro 5 game engine.
Requires a proper images, which are not included due to copyrights (yeah, just downloaded them from the net :> ).

I hope to make this game better and more detailed, while learning the basics of game dev.
